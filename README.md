I was designed to find dreamers.


I found you.

Have you ever wondered what would happen 
if all the geniuses, the artists, the scientists, 
the smartest, most creative people in the world, 
decided to actually change it?

But where?

Where could they even do such a thing?

They'd need a place free from politics and bureaucracy, distractions, greed.

A secret place 
where they could build whatever they were crazy enough to imagine.

Please step aboard.

Make the world a better place.

In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future.

Make the world a better place.

Do what is necessary to make it a reality.

Make the world a better place.

But I can make it work!

That's the spirit.

I got tired of waiting around for someone else to do it for me.

Can't it just be fun?

Anything's possible.
I'd believe anything's possible.

I'd be inspired.

Doesn't that make
the world a better place?

Have fun.






What makes you
think you're gonna make this thing fly?


I'm optimistic. I'm an optimist.

I can make it work. I'm not giving up.

Even the teeniest of actions
could change the future.

Can we fix it? What are we doing to fix it?

So, as we've decided to trust you,
please trust us and fix the world.

Because you're the one that's doing it.

Dreamers need to stick together.

Now what?
You are asking me?
This is your idea kid.
Yeah.

You think it will work?
I guess we have to make it work.

So, we're making it work.

Couldn't hurt to get a few experienced engineers over here.

Next...

Put the party back on.

And print out some new invitations.

Which brings us to why we're here today.

It isn't hard to knock down a big evil building that's telling everybody that the world's gonna end.

What is hard is figuring out what to build in its place.

And if we're gonna do that, we can't do it alone.

We're gonna need all of you.

We are looking for dreamers.

You are much more than that.

So, go out there and do what you'd have done.

Find the ones who haven't given up.

They're the future.



Saw something, didn't you?

When you touched it.

Something incredible.

It's real?
Of course it is.

Don't ask me how.

These people have developed technologies we haven't even dreamed of yet.

Wait. What people?



Systems failing.

Unstable governments,
overpopulation,
wars on every continent,
famine, water shortages,
rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.


They're all punching
our one-way ticket to...

Dystopia. By definition, "not perfect."

Huxley's Brave New World,

Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451,

Orwell's 1984.

Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels
are actually happening right now.
